# 6G-Antenna-Design-Autonomous-Vehicles

This project introduces a novel tooth-shaped patch antenna operating at 77 GHz within the 76â€“81 GHz band. This frequency range is allocated for automotive radar by regulatory bodies such as the FCC and EU. Utilizing millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology, the antenna supports high-speed, low-latency, and high-resolution sensing, making it ideal for autonomous vehicle radar systems in 6G wireless communication.
